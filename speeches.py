lincoln=["Four score and seven years ago our fathers brought forth on this continent, a new nation, conceived in Liberty, and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal","Now we are engaged in a great civil war, testing whether that nation, or any nation so conceived and so dedicated, can long endure", "We are met on a great battle-field of that war","We have come to dedicate a portion of that field, as a final resting place for those who here gave their lives that that nation might live","It is altogether fitting and proper that we should do this","But, in a larger sense, we can not dedicate -- we can not consecrate -- we can not hallow -- this ground","The brave men, living and dead, who struggled here, have consecrated it, far above our poor power to add or detract","The world will little note, nor long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here","It is for us the living, rather, to be dedicated here to the unfinished work which they who fought here have thus far so nobly advanced","It is rather for us to be here dedicated to the great task remaining before us -- that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion -- that we here highly resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain -- that this nation, under God, shall have a new birth of freedom -- and that government of the people, by the people, for the people, shall not perish from the earth"]

kennedy=["We observe today not a victory of party but a celebration of freedom--symbolizing an end as well as a beginning--signifying renewal as well as change","For I have sworn before you and Almighty God the same solemn oath our forebears prescribed nearly a century and three quarters ago", "The world is very different now. For man holds in his mortal hands the power to abolish all forms of human poverty and all forms of human life","And yet the same revolutionary beliefs for which our forebears fought are still at issue around the globe-the belief that the rights of man come not from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God", "We dare not forget today that we are the heirs of that first revolution","Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of Americans--born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage--and unwilling to witness or permit the slow undoing of those human rights to which this nation has always been committed, and to which we are committed today at home and around the world","Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty","This much we pledge--and more","To those old allies whose cultural and spiritual origins we share, we pledge the loyalty of faithful friends","United, there is little we cannot do in a host of cooperative ventures", "Divided, there is little we can do--for we dare not meet a powerful challenge at odds and split asunder","To those new states whom we welcome to the ranks of the free, we pledge our word that one form of colonial control shall not have passed away merely to be replaced by a far more iron tyranny","We shall not always expect to find them supporting our view","But we shall always hope to find them strongly supporting their own freedom-and to remember that, in the past, those who foolishly sought power by riding the back of the tiger ended up inside","To those peoples in the huts and villages of half the globe struggling to break the bonds of mass misery, we pledge our best efforts to help them help themselves, for whatever period is required--not because the communists may be doing it, not because we seek their votes, but because it is right","If a free society cannot help the many who are poor, it cannot save the few who are rich","To our sister republics south of our border, we offer a special pledge--to convert our good words into good deeds--in a new alliance for progress--to assist free men and free governments in casting off the chains of poverty","But this peaceful revolution of hope cannot become the prey of hostile powers","Let all our neighbors know that we shall join with them to oppose aggression or subversion anywhere in the Americas","And let every other power know that this Hemisphere intends to remain the master of its own house","To that world assembly of sovereign states, the United Nations, our last best hope in an age where the instruments of war have far outpaced the instruments of peace, we renew our pledge of support--to prevent it from becoming merely a forum for invective--to strengthen its shield of the new and the weak--and to enlarge the area in which its writ may run","Finally, to those nations who would make themselves our adversary, we offer not a pledge but a request: that both sides begin anew the quest for peace, before the dark powers of destruction unleashed by science engulf all humanity in planned or accidental self-destruction","We dare not tempt them with weakness. For only when our arms are sufficient beyond doubt can we be certain beyond doubt that they will never be employed","But neither can two great and powerful groups of nations take comfort from our present course--both sides overburdened by the cost of modern weapons, both rightly alarmed by the steady spread of the deadly atom, yet both racing to alter that uncertain balance of terror that stays the hand of mankind's final war","So let us begin anew--remembering on both sides that civility is not a sign of weakness, and sincerity is always subject to proof","Let us never negotiate out of fear","But let us never fear to negotiate","Let both sides explore what problems unite us instead of belaboring those problems which divide us","Let both sides, for the first time, formulate serious and precise proposals for the inspection and control of arms--and bring the absolute power to destroy other nations under the absolute control of all nations","Let both sides seek to invoke the wonders of science instead of its terrors","Together let us explore the stars, conquer the deserts, eradicate disease, tap the ocean depths and encourage the arts and commerce","Let both sides unite to heed in all corners of the earth the command of Isaiah--to 'undo the heavy burdens . . . (and) let the oppressed go free'","And if a beach-head of cooperation may push back the jungle of suspicion, let both sides join in creating a new endeavor, not a new balance of power, but a new world of law, where the strong are just and the weak secure and the peace preserved","All this will not be finished in the first one hundred days","Nor will it be finished in the first one thousand days, nor in the life of this Administration, nor even perhaps in our lifetime on this planet","But let us begin","In your hands, my fellow citizens, more than mine, will rest the final success or failure of our course","Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty","The graves of young Americans who answered the call to service surround the globe","Now the trumpet summons us again-not as a call to bear arms, though arms we need--not as a call to battle, though embattled we are--but a call to bear the burden of a long twilight struggle, year in and year out, 'rejoicing in hope, patient in tribulation'--a struggle against the common enemies of man: tyranny, poverty, disease and war itself","Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that historic effort?","In the long history of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger","I do not shrink from this responsibility--I welcome it","I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation","The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it--and the glow from that fire can truly light the world","And so, my fellow Americans: ask not what your country can do for you--ask what you can do for your country","My fellow citizens of the world: ask not what America will do for you, but what together we can do for the freedom of man","Finally, whether you are citizens of America or citizens of the world, ask of us here the same high standards of strength and sacrifice which we ask of you","With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own"]


lannister=["I saved you all","I saved this vile city and all your worthless lives","MY LORDS! Get this lying whore out of my sight and I will give you your confession","Guilty, so guilty. Is that what you wanted to hear?","Of Joffrey's death I am innocent. I am guilty of a more monstrous crime.","I was born. I lived. I am guilty of being a dwarf, I confess it. And no matter how many times my good father forgave me, I have persisted in my infamy.","I have been on trial for being a dwarf my entire life","Nothing but this: I did not do it. Yet now I wish I had", "I wish I had enough poison for you all","You make me sorry that I am not the monster you would have me be, yet there it is","I am innocent, but I will get no justice here","You leave me no choice but to appeal to the gods. I demand trial by battle","I demand trial by battle!"]

king=["I'm happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation","Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation","This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice","It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.","But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free","One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination","One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity","One hundred years later, the Negro is still languishing in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land","So we have come here today to dramatize a shameful condition","In a sense we have come to our nation's capital to cash a check.","When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir","This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the unalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness","It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note insofar as her citizens of color are concerned","Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked 'insufficient funds'","But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt","We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation","So we have come to cash this check -- a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice","We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of now","This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism","Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy","Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice","Now is the time to lift our nation from the quick sands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood","Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children","It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment","This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality","Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning","Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual","There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights.","The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges","But there is something that I must say to my people who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice","In the process of gaining our rightful place we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds","Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred","We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline","We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence","Again and again we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force","The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny","They have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom. We cannot walk alone","As we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead. We cannot turn back","There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, 'When will you be satisfied?'","We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality","We can never be satisfied, as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities.","We cannot be satisfied as long as the Negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one","We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their selfhood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating 'For Whites Only'","We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote","No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream","I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations","Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells","Some of you have come from areas where your quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality","You have been the veterans of creative suffering","Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive","Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed","Let us not wallow in the valley of despair","I say to you today, my friends, so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream","It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream","I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: 'We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal'","I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood","I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice","I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character","I have a dream today","I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of interposition and nullification; one day right there in Alabama, little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers","I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight, and the glory of the Lord shall be revealed, and all flesh shall see it together","This is our hope. This is the faith that I go back to the South with. With this faith we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope","With this faith we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood","With this faith we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day","This will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with a new meaning, 'My country, 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee I sing. Land where my fathers died, land of the pilgrim's pride, from every mountainside, let freedom ring'","And if America is to be a great nation this must become true","So let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire","Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York","Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania!","Let freedom ring from the snowcapped Rockies of Colorado!","Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California!","But not only that; let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia!","Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee!","Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi. From every mountainside, let freedom ring","And when this happens, when we allow freedom to ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual, 'Free at last! free at last! thank God Almighty, we are free at last!'"]
